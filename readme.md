This repo is my playground to know algorithms and Kotlin syntax better.

Some implementations may be overengineered, because I wanted to use as much Kotlin syntax sugar and features as possible. 

Algorithms are based either on "The Algorithm Design Manual" by Steven Skiena, or videos of Tushar Roy which can be found on his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/tusharroy2525
